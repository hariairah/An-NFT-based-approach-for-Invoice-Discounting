Invoice Discounting is a financing technique where a seller sells his goods or services to the Buyer and issues an Invoice for this good/service with the due date mentioned. The seller can get immediate cash by selling unpaid invoices to a third party, which we call the financier, at a discount. The tradtional method of invoice discounting is not very transparent and is prone to double spending attacks where the seller can use the same unpaid invoice twice or more to get funds.
Tokenizing the invoice helps prevent this. With our approach involving smart contracts, we also ensure that the process is made tamper-proof and transparent.

Working of our solution to counter double-spending and other security issues:
- A seller will first be able to mint a token using the invoice. This invoice is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) which is a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.
- This token then needs to be signed by the buyer 
- Only when a token has been signed can the seller put this token for sale
- Any user can then pose as a financier and buy this token if they are interested. Once a token has been bought, ownership gets transferred to this user

Using blockchain and NFTs for invoice discounts makes things safer, more transparent, and easier to check. But making rules and getting everyone to use it might still need some work.
